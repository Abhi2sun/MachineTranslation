# MachineTranslation
Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a machine translation model using T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) from Hugging Face's Transformers library. T5 is a versatile model that can handle various NLP tasks by framing them as text generation tasks. Here, T5 is fine-tuned to perform machine translation (e.g., English-to-French translation) using a translation dataset.

Key Components:


Instructions to install necessary libraries, including Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers and datasets.

1.Data Preparation:
Details on acquiring and preparing a translation dataset. This may include loading data from Hugging Face Datasets, such as WMT (a standard dataset for machine translation).
Preprocessing steps for tokenizing text, structuring input prompts (e.g., "translate English to French: <text>"), and formatting target translations.

2.Model Fine-Tuning:
Explanation of how to load a pre-trained T5 model and tokenizer (e.g., t5-small or t5-base) and fine-tune it on the translation dataset.
Use of the custom configuration can be changed to Hugging face Trainer API which itself provides more flexibility for Hyperparameter tuning using OPTUNA .specifying hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and evaluation metrics.

3.Inference:
Instructions for creating a function to translate new English sentences into French (or other target languages) using the fine-tuned T5 model.
Example code to demonstrate how to input a sentence and retrieve its translated output.

4.Evaluation:
Use of evaluation metrics like SacreBLEU (can also use ROUGE score)to assess translation quality on a test set.
Sample code for evaluating model performance and logging results.
Additional Features:

5.Path forward:
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Adapting the project to other translation tasks (e.g., different language pairs).
Experiment tracking and logging (e.g., using TensorBoard or Weights & Biases).

6.Requirements and Dependencies:
List of required Python packages and versions (e.g., transformers, torch, datasets).
